Node Handover
===================================================

| Here we will explain the process of **node handover**.

---------------------------------------------------
What is Handover?
---------------------------------------------------

| **Handover** is a feature that allows **a running node to be replaced without stopping**.

* Nodes participating in the consensus process in the entire network may need to be replaced due to various circumstances.
* There may be cases where the program running the node needs to be updated, the node needs to be moved to another cloud service, or the node fails. In such cases, you can replace an already running node with an alternate node without stopping it.

| Handover is one of the key features that can support public networks in the future.

---------------------------------------------------
Handover Scenario
---------------------------------------------------

* **Node A**: the running node
* **Node A-sub**: the node to be replaced
* Condition: *A-sub* must have the same configuration as *A*. However, the value of ``network.url`` must be different.

| Node *A*'s Configuration

.. code-block:: none

    address: Asas
    network-id: mitum
    network:
        url: https://172.17.0.1:54321
    privatekey: KyfqCLSEyfUhskZ63WtVH3m3pGgnurFHuTgkgu73Pgyjf8sxbp8Rmpr    

| Node *A-sub*'s Configuration

.. code-block:: none

    address: Asas
    network-id: mitum
    network:
        url: https://172.17.0.2:54321
    privatekey: KyfqCLSEyfUhskZ63WtVH3m3pGgnurFHuTgkgu73Pgyjf8sxbp8Rmpr

---------------------------------------------------
How to Run
---------------------------------------------------

| Under above scenario, it works along the following steps,

* *A* is running as a suffrage node and wants to replace it with *A-sub*.
* After confirming that *A* is in **CONSENSUS** state, run *A-sub* with ``node run`` command using the above config.
* *A-sub* performs synchronization by collecting previous block data and enters **SYNCING** state.

* After confirming that the *A-sub* has changed to **SYNCING** state, execute the ``start-handover`` command on *A-sub* node.

.. code-block:: shell

    $ mitum-currency node start-handover \
        "Asas" \
        "KyfqCLSEyfUhskZ63WtVH3m3pGgnurFHuTgkgu73Pgyjf8sxbp8Rmpr" \
        "mitum" \
        "https://172.17.0.2:54321"

* When *B* finishes syncing, *Handover* starts.
* *A* is switched from **CONSENSUS** state to **SYNCING** state, and *A-sub* performs the consensus process on behalf of *A*.
* Other nodes in the suffrage network add *A-sub* as a suffrage node instead of *A* and proceed with the consensus process.
* Operation Seals delivered to *A* are delivered to other nodes.

What If a start-handover is sent to A after the Handover is over?
------------------------------------------------------------------

* *A* replaced by *A-sub* is converted to **SYNCING** state.
* After the handover is finished, *A* is internally converted to the same state as *A-sub* before the ``start-handover`` command.
* If a ``start-handover`` command is delivered to *A* in this state, from then on, *A* attempts to replace *A-sub*.

How can I check that the start-handover is finished?
-----------------------------------------------------

* When checking *NodeInfo* of *A-sub*, it is changed to **CONSENSUS** state.
* When *A*’s *NodeInfo* is checked, if it is changed to **SYNCING** state, handover is normally completed.
